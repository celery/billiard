2.7.3.11 - 2012-08-01
---------------------

- Adds support for FreeBSD 7+

    Fix contributed by koobs.

- Pool: New argument ``allow_restart`` is now required to enable
  the pool process sentinel that is required to restart the pool.

    It's disabled by default, which reduces the number of file
    descriptors/semaphores required to run the pool.

- Pool: Now emits a warning if a worker process exited with errorcode.

    But not if the error code is 155, which is now returned if the worker
    process was recycled (maxtasksperchild).

- Python 3 compatibility fixes.

- Python 2.5 compatibility fixes.

2.7.3.10 - 2012-06-26
---------------------

- The ``TimeLimitExceeded`` exception string representation
  only showed the seconds as a number, it now gives a more human
  friendly description.

- Fixed typo in ``LaxBoundedSemaphore.shrink``.

- Pool: ``ResultHandler.handle_event`` no longer requires
  any arguments.

- setup.py bdist now works

2.7.3.9 - 2012-06-03
--------------------

- Environment variable ``MP_MAIN_FILE`` envvar is now set to
  the path of the ``__main__`` module when execv is enabled.

- Pool: Errors occuring in the TaskHandler are now reported.

2.7.3.8 - 2012-06-01
--------------------

- Can now be installed on Py 3.2

- Issue #12091: simplify ApplyResult and MapResult with threading.Event

  Patch by Charles-Francois Natali

- Pool: Support running without TimeoutHandler thread.

    - The with_*_thread arguments has also been replaced with
      a single `threads=True` argument.

    - Two new pool callbacks:

        - ``on_timeout_set(job, soft, hard)``

            Applied when a task is executed with a timeout.

        - ``on_timeout_cancel(job)``

            Applied when a timeout is cancelled (the job completed)

2.7.3.7 - 2012-05-21
--------------------

- Fixes Python 2.5 support.

2.7.3.6 - 2012-05-21
--------------------

- Pool: Can now be used in an event loop, without starting the supporting
  threads (TimeoutHandler still not supported)

    To facilitate this the pool has gained the following keyword arguments:

        - ``with_task_thread``
        - ``with_result_thread``
        - ``with_supervisor_thread``
        - ``on_process_up``

            Callback called with Process instance as argument
            whenever a new worker process is added.

            Used to add new process fds to the eventloop::

                def on_process_up(proc):
                    hub.add_reader(proc.sentinel, pool.maintain_pool)

        - ``on_process_down``

            Callback called with Process instance as argument
            whenever a new worker process is found dead.

            Used to remove process fds from the eventloop::

                def on_process_down(proc):
                    hub.remove(proc.sentinel)

        - ``semaphore``

            Sets the semaphore used to protect from adding new items to the
            pool when no processes available.  The default is a threaded
            one, so this can be used to change to an async semaphore.

    And the following attributes::

        - ``readers``

            A map of ``fd`` -> ``callback``, to be registered in an eventloop.
            Currently this is only the result outqueue with a callback
            that processes all currently incoming results.

    And the following methods::

        - ``did_start_ok``

            To be called after starting the pool, and after setting up the
            eventloop with the pool fds, to ensure that the worker processes
            didn't immediately exit caused by an error (internal/memory).

        - ``maintain_pool``

            Public version of ``_maintain_pool`` that handles max restarts.

- Pool: Process too frequent restart protection now only counts if the process
  had a non-successful exitcode.

    This to take into account the maxtasksperchild option, and allowing
    processes to exit cleanly on their own.

- Pool: New options max_restart + max_restart_freq

    This means that the supervisor can't restart processes
    faster than max_restart' times per max_restart_freq seconds
    (like the Erlang supervisor maxR & maxT settings).

    The pool is closed and joined if the max restart
    frequency is exceeded, where previously it would keep restarting
    at an unlimited rate, possibly crashing the system.

    The current default value is to stop if it exceeds
    100 * process_count restarts in 1 seconds.  This may change later.

    It will only count processes with an unsuccessful exit code,
    this is to take into account the ``maxtasksperchild`` setting
    and code that voluntarily exits.

- Pool: The ``WorkerLostError`` message now includes the exitcode of the
  process that disappeared.


2.7.3.5 - 2012-05-09
--------------------

- Now always cleans up after ``sys.exc_info()`` to avoid
  cyclic references.

- ExceptionInfo without arguments now defaults to ``sys.exc_info``.

- Forking can now be disabled using the
  ``MULTIPROCESSING_FORKING_DISABLE`` environment variable.

    Also this envvar is set so that the behavior is inherited
    after execv.

- The semaphore cleanup process started when execv is used
  now sets a useful process name if the ``setproctitle``
  module is installed.

- Sets the ``FORKED_BY_MULTIPROCESSING``
  environment variable if forking is disabled.


2.7.3.4 - 2012-04-27
--------------------

- Added `billiard.ensure_multiprocessing()`

    Raises NotImplementedError if the platform does not support
    multiprocessing (e.g. Jython).


2.7.3.3 - 2012-04-23
--------------------

- PyPy now falls back to using its internal _multiprocessing module,
  so everything works except for forking_enable(False) (which
  silently degrades).

- Fixed Python 2.5 compat issues.

- Uses more with statements

- Merged some of the changes from the Python 3 branch.

2.7.3.2 - 2012-04-20
--------------------

- Now installs on PyPy/Jython (but does not work).

2.7.3.1 - 2012-04-20
--------------------

- Python 2.5 support added.

2.7.3.0 - 2012-04-20
--------------------

- Updated from Python 2.7.3

- Python 2.4 support removed, now only supports 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7.
  (may consider py3k support at some point).

- Pool improvments from Celery.

- no-execv patch added (http://bugs.python.org/issue8713)
