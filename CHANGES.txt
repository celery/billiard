2.6.2.1 -- 2009-07-30

 * Fix and properly document the multiprocessing module's logging
   support, expose the internal levels and provide proper usage
   examples.

 * Issue #5261: Patch multiprocessing's semaphore.c to support context
   manager use: "with multiprocessing.Lock()" works now.

   _check_logger_class from multiprocessing.
