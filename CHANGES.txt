2.7.3.28 - 2013-04-16
---------------------

- Pool: Fixed regression that disabled the deadlock
  fix in 2.7.3.24

- Pool: RestartFreqExceeded could be raised prematurely.

- Process: Include pid in startup and process INFO logs.

2.7.3.27 - 2013-04-12
---------------------

- Manager now works again.

- Python 3 fixes for billiard.connection.

- Fixed invalid argument bug when running on Python 3.3

    Fix contributed by Nathan Wan.

- Ignore OSError when setting up signal handlers.

2.7.3.26 - 2013-04-09
---------------------

- Pool: Child processes must ignore SIGINT.

2.7.3.25 - 2013-04-09
---------------------

- Pool: 2.7.3.24 broke support for subprocesses (Issue #48).

    Signals that should be ignored were instead handled
    by terminating.

2.7.3.24 - 2013-04-08
---------------------

- Pool:  Make sure finally blocks are called when process exits
  due to a signal.

    This fixes a deadlock problem when the process is killed
    while having acquired the shared semaphore.  However, this solution
    does not protect against the processes being killed, a more elaborate
    solution is required for that. Hopefully this will be fixed soon in a
    later version.

- Pool:  Can now use GDB to debug pool child processes.

- Fixes Python 3 compatibility problems.

2.7.3.23 - 2013-03-22
---------------------

- Windows: Now catches SystemExit from setuptools while trying to build
  the C extension (Issue #41).

2.7.3.22 - 2013-03-08
---------------------

- Pool: apply_async now supports a ``callbacks_propagate`` keyword
  argument that can be a tuple of exceptions to propagate in callbacks.
  (callback, errback, accept_callback, timeout_callback).

- Errors are no longer logged for OK and recycle exit codes.

    This would cause normal maxtasksperchild recycled process
    to log an error.

- Fixed Python 2.5 compatibility problem (Issue #33).

- FreeBSD: Compilation now disables semaphores if Python was built
  without it (Issue #40).

2.7.3.21 - 2013-02-11
---------------------

- Fixed typo EX_REUSE -> EX_RECYCLE

- Code now conforms to new pep8.py rules.

2.7.3.20 - 2013-02-08
---------------------

- Pool: Disable restart limit if maxR is not set.

- Pool: Now uses os.kill instead of signal.signal.

    Contributed by Lukasz Langa

- Fixed name error in process.py

- Pool: ApplyResult.get now properly raises exceptions.

    Fix contributed by xentac.

2.7.3.19 - 2012-11-30
---------------------

- Fixes problem at shutdown when gc has collected symbols.

- Pool now always uses _kill for Py2.5 compatibility on Windows (Issue #32).

- Fixes Python 3 compatibility issues

2.7.3.18 - 2012-11-05
---------------------

- [Pool] Fix for check_timeouts if not set.

    Fix contributed by Dmitry Sukhov

- Fixed pickle problem with Traceback.

    Code.frame.__loader__ is now ignored as it may be set to
    an unpickleable object.

- The Django old-layout warning was always showing.

2.7.3.17 - 2012-09-26
---------------------

- Fixes typo

2.7.3.16 - 2012-09-26
---------------------

- Windows: Fixes for SemLock._rebuild (Issue #24).

- Pool: Job terminated with terminate_job now raises
  billiard.exceptions.Terminated.

2.7.3.15 - 2012-09-21
---------------------

- Windows: Fixes unpickling of SemLock when using fallback.

- Windows: Fixes installation when no C compiler.

2.7.3.14 - 2012-09-20
---------------------

- Installation now works again for Python 3.

2.7.3.13 - 2012-09-14
---------------------

- Merged with Python trunk (many authors, many fixes: see Python changelog in
  trunk).

- Using execv now also works with older Django projects using setup_environ
  (Issue #10).

- Billiard now installs with a warning that the C extension could not be built
  if a compiler is not installed or the build fails in some other way.

    It really is recommended to have the C extension installed when running
    with force execv, but this change also makes it easier to install.

- Pool: Hard timeouts now sends KILL shortly after TERM so that C extensions
  cannot block the signal.

    Python signal handlers are called in the interpreter, so they cannot
    be called while a C extension is blocking the interpreter from running.

- Now uses a timeout value for Thread.join that doesn't exceed the maximum
  on some platforms.

- Fixed bug in the SemLock fallback used when C extensions not installed.

    Fix contributed by Mher Movsisyan.

- Pool: Now sets a Process.index attribute for every process in the pool.

    This number will always be between 0 and concurrency-1, and
    can be used to e.g. create a logfile for each process in the pool
    without creating a new logfile whenever a process is replaced.

2.7.3.12 - 2012-08-05
---------------------

- Fixed Python 2.5 compatibility issue.

- New Pool.terminate_job(pid) to terminate a job without raising WorkerLostError

2.7.3.11 - 2012-08-01
---------------------

- Adds support for FreeBSD 7+

    Fix contributed by koobs.

- Pool: New argument ``allow_restart`` is now required to enable
  the pool process sentinel that is required to restart the pool.

    It's disabled by default, which reduces the number of file
    descriptors/semaphores required to run the pool.

- Pool: Now emits a warning if a worker process exited with error-code.

    But not if the error code is 155, which is now returned if the worker
    process was recycled (maxtasksperchild).

- Python 3 compatibility fixes.

- Python 2.5 compatibility fixes.

2.7.3.10 - 2012-06-26
---------------------

- The ``TimeLimitExceeded`` exception string representation
  only included the seconds as a number, it now gives a more human
  friendly description.

- Fixed typo in ``LaxBoundedSemaphore.shrink``.

- Pool: ``ResultHandler.handle_event`` no longer requires
  any arguments.

- setup.py bdist now works

2.7.3.9 - 2012-06-03
--------------------

- Environment variable ``MP_MAIN_FILE`` envvar is now set to
  the path of the ``__main__`` module when execv is enabled.

- Pool: Errors occurring in the TaskHandler are now reported.

2.7.3.8 - 2012-06-01
--------------------

- Can now be installed on Py 3.2

- Issue #12091: simplify ApplyResult and MapResult with threading.Event

  Patch by Charles-Francois Natali

- Pool: Support running without TimeoutHandler thread.

    - The with_*_thread arguments has also been replaced with
      a single `threads=True` argument.

    - Two new pool callbacks:

        - ``on_timeout_set(job, soft, hard)``

            Applied when a task is executed with a timeout.

        - ``on_timeout_cancel(job)``

            Applied when a timeout is cancelled (the job completed)

2.7.3.7 - 2012-05-21
--------------------

- Fixes Python 2.5 support.

2.7.3.6 - 2012-05-21
--------------------

- Pool: Can now be used in an event loop, without starting the supporting
  threads (TimeoutHandler still not supported)

    To facilitate this the pool has gained the following keyword arguments:

        - ``with_task_thread``
        - ``with_result_thread``
        - ``with_supervisor_thread``
        - ``on_process_up``

            Callback called with Process instance as argument
            whenever a new worker process is added.

            Used to add new process fds to the eventloop::

                def on_process_up(proc):
                    hub.add_reader(proc.sentinel, pool.maintain_pool)

        - ``on_process_down``

            Callback called with Process instance as argument
            whenever a new worker process is found dead.

            Used to remove process fds from the eventloop::

                def on_process_down(proc):
                    hub.remove(proc.sentinel)

        - ``semaphore``

            Sets the semaphore used to protect from adding new items to the
            pool when no processes available.  The default is a threaded
            one, so this can be used to change to an async semaphore.

    And the following attributes::

        - ``readers``

            A map of ``fd`` -> ``callback``, to be registered in an eventloop.
            Currently this is only the result outqueue with a callback
            that processes all currently incoming results.

    And the following methods::

        - ``did_start_ok``

            To be called after starting the pool, and after setting up the
            eventloop with the pool fds, to ensure that the worker processes
            didn't immediately exit caused by an error (internal/memory).

        - ``maintain_pool``

            Public version of ``_maintain_pool`` that handles max restarts.

- Pool: Process too frequent restart protection now only counts if the process
  had a non-successful exit-code.

    This to take into account the maxtasksperchild option, and allowing
    processes to exit cleanly on their own.

- Pool: New options max_restart + max_restart_freq

    This means that the supervisor can't restart processes
    faster than max_restart' times per max_restart_freq seconds
    (like the Erlang supervisor maxR & maxT settings).

    The pool is closed and joined if the max restart
    frequency is exceeded, where previously it would keep restarting
    at an unlimited rate, possibly crashing the system.

    The current default value is to stop if it exceeds
    100 * process_count restarts in 1 seconds.  This may change later.

    It will only count processes with an unsuccessful exit code,
    this is to take into account the ``maxtasksperchild`` setting
    and code that voluntarily exits.

- Pool: The ``WorkerLostError`` message now includes the exit-code of the
  process that disappeared.


2.7.3.5 - 2012-05-09
--------------------

- Now always cleans up after ``sys.exc_info()`` to avoid
  cyclic references.

- ExceptionInfo without arguments now defaults to ``sys.exc_info``.

- Forking can now be disabled using the
  ``MULTIPROCESSING_FORKING_DISABLE`` environment variable.

    Also this envvar is set so that the behavior is inherited
    after execv.

- The semaphore cleanup process started when execv is used
  now sets a useful process name if the ``setproctitle``
  module is installed.

- Sets the ``FORKED_BY_MULTIPROCESSING``
  environment variable if forking is disabled.


2.7.3.4 - 2012-04-27
--------------------

- Added `billiard.ensure_multiprocessing()`

    Raises NotImplementedError if the platform does not support
    multiprocessing (e.g. Jython).


2.7.3.3 - 2012-04-23
--------------------

- PyPy now falls back to using its internal _multiprocessing module,
  so everything works except for forking_enable(False) (which
  silently degrades).

- Fixed Python 2.5 compat. issues.

- Uses more with statements

- Merged some of the changes from the Python 3 branch.

2.7.3.2 - 2012-04-20
--------------------

- Now installs on PyPy/Jython (but does not work).

2.7.3.1 - 2012-04-20
--------------------

- Python 2.5 support added.

2.7.3.0 - 2012-04-20
--------------------

- Updated from Python 2.7.3

- Python 2.4 support removed, now only supports 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7.
  (may consider py3k support at some point).

- Pool improvements from Celery.

- no-execv patch added (http://bugs.python.org/issue8713)
