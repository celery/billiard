About
-----

``billiard`` is a fork of the Python 2.7 `multiprocessing <https://docs.python.org/library/multiprocessing.html>`_
package. The multiprocessing package itself is a renamed and updated version of
R Oudkerk's `pyprocessing <https://pypi.org/project/processing/>`_ package.
This standalone variant draws its fixes/improvements from python-trunk and provides
additional bug fixes and improvements.

- This package would not be possible if not for the contributions of not only
  the current maintainers but all of the contributors to the original pyprocessing
  package listed `here <http://pyprocessing.berlios.de/doc/THANKS.html>`_.

- Also, it is a fork of the multiprocessing backport package by Christian Heims.

- It includes the no-execv patch contributed by R. Oudkerk.

- And the Pool improvements previously located in `Celery`_.

- Billiard is used in and is a dependency for `Celery`_ and is maintained by the
  Celery team.

.. _`Celery`: http://celeryproject.org
